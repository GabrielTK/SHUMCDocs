**Use**

Hold the Tape Measure. Crouch + right click on the block you want to measure distance from. That block is called an **anchor**. To change the location of the anchor block, crouch + right click on a different block.

You are then able to right click on any block to measure the distance between the anchor and that block. The measured distance is shown in chat, and it is rounded to 3 decimal places.\
