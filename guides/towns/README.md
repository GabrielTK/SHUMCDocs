# üèô Towns

Towns in Minecraft are player-created communities that offer numerous benefits and opportunities for collaboration, growth, and protection. As a player, you may consider setting up a town when you have gathered sufficient resources and have found a suitable location to establish a thriving community. Towns provide an ideal environment for players to band together, share resources, trade goods, and work on joint projects.

One of the most significant advantages of creating a town is the protection it offers against griefing and natural disasters. By setting up a town, you establish a safe haven for your builds, items, and fellow residents, ensuring that your hard work remains secure from malicious actions or unexpected calamities. Establishing a town allows you to create a strong, supportive community while maintaining peace of mind, knowing that your efforts and achievements are safeguarded from harm.
