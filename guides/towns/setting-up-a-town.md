# üìù Setting up a town

## Basic Town Setup

### **Step 1:** Gather Resources

Before you can establish your own town, you'll need to gather sufficient resources to fund its creation. Collect materials such as wood, stone, and ores, and then craft items or sell your resources to other players to amass the required currency.

### **Step 2:** Find the Perfect Location

Scout the world to find a suitable location for your town. Consider factors such as access to resources, proximity to other towns, and the overall aesthetic of the area. Ensure that the chosen spot is not claimed by another player or within a protected zone.

### **Step 3:** Create Your Town

&#x20;Once you've acquired the necessary funds and found a prime location, use the command `/town create [town_name]` to officially create your town. This will also set your current position as the town's home block, which will act as the central point of your town.

### **Step 4:** Designate Plots and Zones

&#x20;As the mayor of your town, you have the authority to designate specific plots and zones for various purposes. Assign plots for residential, commercial, or industrial use, and create special zones for public facilities like farms, mines, and parks.

### **Step 5:** Invite Residents

Now that your town is established, invite other players to join you as residents. Use the command `/town invite [player_name]` to send invitations. As players accept your invites, their homes will automatically be added to the town's borders, expanding your town's territory.

### **Step 6:** Manage Town Settings

&#x20;Customize your town's settings, such as taxes, PvP rules, and building permissions, to create the ideal community for your residents. Use the various town management commands to adjust these settings according to your preferences.

### **Step 7:** Expand and Prosper

&#x20;With your town up and running, focus on expanding and prospering. Encourage your residents to build, trade, and collaborate on projects, making your town a thriving hub within the SHUcraft community.

Congratulations! You've successfully set up your town. Continue to grow, innovate, and forge lasting friendships with your fellow residents as you create a unique and vibrant community to call your own.
