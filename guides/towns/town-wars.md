**Introduction/Game-play:**

There are 6 basic types of war

* Riot - One town fighting amongst itself. Players side with the city or the rioters via team selection.
* Town vs Town - Two towns fight against each other.
* Civil War - One nation fighting amongst itself. Towns side with the capital or the rebels via team selection.
* Nation vs Nation - Two nations fight against each other.
* Alliance vs Alliance - Two nations fight against each other, with both nations' allies joining the fight.
* World War - All nations with enemies will be thrown into war. Similar to the old EventWar.

Wars are begun by an admin or via town-purchased Declaration of War books.

Declarations of War are purchased via Tokens using

```
/town redeem {wartype}
```

***

**Declaration of War Books:**

Declaration of War books are how players start wars. These books are purchased for Tokens using the `/town redeem` command. By default riots DoW books cost the least, with the costs increasing as the scopes of the wars increase as well. This means that riots and town wars will happen more often than civil wars, nation wars and world wars. A town must be a part of a nation to redeem their tokens for civil war, nation war and world wars books. It is possible for towns to purchase DoW books and then give them to other towns. This means powerful nations can foment wars in other towns to destabilize them. Declaration of War books are used by holding the book and using the `/declare war [wartype] [arg]` command, this is documented in the books themselves.

**TownBlock HP Sytem:**

When a war type has the TownBlockHP system enabled all of the townblocks in each warring town are given an HP amount. By default normal townblocks have 60 and homeblocks have 120 hp. HP is lowered when attackers are stood in the townblock, and the attackers outnumber any allies of the town being attacked. Optionally, townblock HPs can be healed when the allies outnumber the attackers. Townblocks must be attacked from the edge of town, inwards towards the town's homeblock. When townblocks are attacked, fireworks appear in the air above. There is a configurable minimum height that players must be in the world to be considered an attacker. If a jail plot has its HP dropped to zero, all of the prisoners of war will be unjailed in a prison break, and the jail will no longer be usable for the duration of the war. If the War allows it, TownBlocks can switch Towns when they are dropped to 0hp. See the /eventwar guide \[wartype] to learn if this is enabled on your server for TownWar, NationWar, AllianceWar or WorldWar. It is not available for Riots or CivilWars. If the War allows it and TownBlocks-can-switch-Towns is true, TownBlocks which have switched sides can be re-conquered after a configurable period of time. See the /eventwar guide \[wartype] to learn if this is enabled on your server for TownWar, NationWar, AllianceWar or WorldWar. It is not available for Riots or CivilWars.

**Surrendering:**

When a war type allows surrendering, players are able to decide if they can give up. For Riot, CivilWar, AllianceWar, and WorldWar types, the player uses /surrender. Riots allow for anyone to surrender. CivilWar only allows a mayor to surrender their town. WorldWar only allows a king to surrender their nation. If Riot wars have town conquering enabled, and the Mayor is the one surrendering, their Town will be taken over by the Rebel with the highest score. If CivilWar has town conquering enabled, and the King is the one surrendering, the rebel Town with the highest score will become the new Capital. For TownWar and NationWar, it is more complicated. The town or nation that wishes to give in must create an offer. This offer can be for a WhitePeace (nothing,) Money, Towns or Money & Towns combined. See '/surrender ?' for correct command syntax. The offer is then sent to the mayor or king on the opposite side for their approval. If accepted the war is over and any money or towns is exchanged. In TownWars, the surrendering Town can only offer itself in surrender, to be merged into the victorious Town. In NationWars, the surrendering Nation can offer itself or any of its Towns in surrender, to be conquered by the victorious Nation.

**Jails and Prisoners of War:**

EventWar makes generous use of the Towny Jail plots, players killed in enemy territory will be transferred to the town's primary jail (falling back to other jails if the primary jail has lost its HP,) to live as a POW (prisoner-of-war.) In riot wars, players are unjailed if they can leave the jail plot. In other war types they must exit the town's land. Jailbreaks occur when a jail's HP is dropped to zero and all prisoners are freed. While jailed, players are unable to score kills, lose their lives or damage townblock HP's.
